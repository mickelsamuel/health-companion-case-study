    <!-- (2) USER RESEARCH -->
    <section id="research" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>2. User Research</h2>

      <p>
        Our primary goal was to gather in-depth knowledge of users with chronic conditions and 
        their relationship with digital tools that track health information. We used a 
        <strong>mixed-methods approach</strong>, combining both quantitative and qualitative research:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Online Survey (40 respondents):</strong> Focused on daily medication habits, frequency 
        of missed doses, appointment scheduling methods, interest in mental wellness features, and 
        preferred notification types.</li>
        <li><strong>In-depth Interviews (5 participants):</strong> Delved deeper into personal challenges, 
        emotional triggers (e.g., stress when scheduling appointments), and coping mechanisms. 
        Participants were 30–60 years old with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and 
        chronic migraines.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Research:</strong> Reviewed existing health apps (MyChart, Medisafe, 
        Talkspace) and medical journals to understand best practices and potential pitfalls in 
        chronic disease management.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Key Insights from Research:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>App Overload:</strong> Users dislike juggling multiple apps for different health 
        tasks. A single integrated solution is preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Adherence:</strong> Over <span class="highlight">60%</span> of participants admitted missing 
        at least one dose per week, highlighting a strong need for intuitive reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Health Integration:</strong> A notable portion of users expressed interest in 
        mental wellness resources within the same app, supporting stress management.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication with Healthcare Professionals:</strong> Slow or unclear communication 
        with doctors was a frequent complaint.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility & Usability:</strong> Many older adults found high-complexity apps 
        difficult to navigate. A simple, clear UI is essential.</li>
      </ol>

        In summary, <strong>users demanded a single, user-friendly experience</strong> 
        that bundles medication tracking and appointment scheduling while offering 
        mental health resources. Our next step was to translate these insights into 
        <em>personas</em> that would guide our design decisions.

    <!-- (3) PERSONAS -->
    <section id="personas" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>3. Personas</h2>
      <p>
        Based on our research, we developed three personas representing key user segments. 
        Each persona encapsulates different goals, motivations, and pain points, ensuring 
        that our design solutions address a diverse range of needs.
      </p>

      <div class="persona-grid">
        <!-- Persona 1: John -->
        <div class="persona-card">

          <h3>John, 57 <span style="font-weight:400;">• Hypertension & High Cholesterol</span></h3>
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Track blood pressure meds, reduce hospital visits, manage diet tips.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Forgets medication doses, struggles with complicated apps, 
          wants to share data with family doctor easily.</p>
          <p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Maintaining independence, ensuring stable health for 
          family’s peace of mind, saving time on complex scheduling processes.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Persona 2: Alicia -->
        <div class="persona-card">
          <img src="persona-alicia.jpg" alt="Alicia, 33" class="persona-img" />
          <h3>Alicia, 33 <span style="font-weight:400;">• Migraines & Work-Life Balance</span></h3>
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Quickly log migraines, set medication reminders, find stress management tools.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Juggling a busy schedule, needs fast, on-the-go solutions, 
          doesn't want complicated sign-in flows every time.</p>
          <p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Minimizing downtime due to migraines, proactively 
          addressing triggers, fitting health tasks into a fast-paced lifestyle.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Persona 3: Carlos -->
        <div class="persona-card">
          <img src="persona-carlos.jpg" alt="Carlos, 41" class="persona-img" />
          <h3>Carlos, 41 <span style="font-weight:400;">• Type 2 Diabetes</span></h3>
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Track insulin doses and diet, schedule regular checkups, sync data with family.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Misses insulin doses due to busy shift schedule, needs 
          real-time push notifications, uncertain about data privacy.</p>
          <p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Maintaining stable glucose levels, reassuring family members, 
          improving diet through daily logging of food intake and sugar levels.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Each persona guided decisions around <em>feature prioritization, information architecture, 
        and interface design</em>. We ensured our design would be intuitive for both the tech-savvy 
        younger demographic (Alicia) and older adults who struggle with more complex technology (John), 
        while still meeting specialized needs (like those of Carlos).

    <!-- (4) USER JOURNEY MAP -->
    <section id="journeymap" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>4. User Journey Map</h2>
      <p>
        To understand the typical process a user undergoes when interacting with our app, we 
        created a journey map reflecting key stages and emotional states. For illustration, 
        this journey map focuses on <strong>John’s experience</strong> from the moment 
        he realizes he needs to refill his blood pressure meds to scheduling a follow-up 
        with his cardiologist.
      </p>
      <img src="user-journey.jpg" alt="User Journey Map" class="journey-image" />
      <p class="caption">
        Key stages: Awareness → App Access → Medication Tracking → Appointment Scheduling → Follow-up
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Breakdown of John’s Journey:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> John hears from his doctor about a new app to help manage 
        chronic conditions. He’s cautious but curious.</li>
        <li><strong>Onboarding & Setup:</strong> John downloads the app and sees a simple 
        onboarding flow that explains how to enter his medication details. He worries it might 
        be too technical, but quick tutorial tips guide him through the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Tracking:</strong> Once set up, John receives daily reminders 
        to log his blood pressure meds. He appreciates the push notifications but occasionally 
        forgets to open the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Doctor Communication:</strong> John notices he can send simple status 
        updates or questions to his healthcare professional. Initially, he’s uncertain how 
        to phrase them, but the app’s suggested templates help him out.</li>
        <li><strong>Appointment Booking:</strong> John tries scheduling a routine check-up 
        in-app. The limited slot availability irritates him, but the app suggests alternatives, 
        reducing frustration.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up & Long-Term Engagement:</strong> As John grows comfortable 
        with daily usage, he begins exploring wellness tips and even tries some relaxation 
        exercises. Over time, he feels more confident managing his health.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By mapping each stage—alongside John’s emotions, pain points, and opportunities—we 
        identified friction points (e.g., confusion during sign-up, difficulty scheduling 
        appointments, fear of complicated technology) and designed specific solutions 
        (e.g., intuitive onboarding, appointment scheduling alternatives, simple UI).

    <!-- (5) USER FLOWCHART -->
    <section id="userflow" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>5. User Flow</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a detailed flowchart outlining the entire user path from Onboarding and Sign-Up 
        or Login, to the Home Dashboard, then navigating to Medications, Appointments, Wellness, 
        and Profile. It also highlights key sub-actions like adding medication reminders, 
        scheduling/rescheduling appointments, and more.
      </p>

      <p class="caption">
        Start → Onboarding → Login/Signup → Home → Medications / Appointments / Wellness / Profile
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Flow Rationale:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> If first-time user, they see a quick overview and can opt 
        to skip or proceed with a tutorial. This accommodates users with varying familiarity levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Login vs. Sign-Up:</strong> New users create an account, returning users 
        directly log in. “Forgot Password” flow is clearly accessible from the login screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Home Screen:</strong> Displays quick links to major features (Medication, 
        Appointment, Wellness, Profile). Users can easily jump back to the home screen 
        without confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Screen:</strong> Facilitates adding/editing medication details, 
        logging doses, setting push reminders, and confirming taken doses.</li>
        <li><strong>Appointment Screen:</strong> Schedules new check-ups, reschedules or 
        cancels existing ones, and integrates with push notifications for reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Wellness Screen:</strong> Offers mental health exercises, daily mood 
        tracking, and curated resources to reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Screen:</strong> Houses user info, family-sharing options, 
        accountability settings, and a logout function.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This user flow ensures minimal friction and quick access to essential features, 
        thus promoting consistent usage over time.

    <!-- (6) WIREFRAMES & PROTOTYPE -->
    <section id="wireframes" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>6. Wireframes & High-Fidelity Screens</h2>
      <p>
        Our design process followed an <strong>iterative approach</strong>. We began with 
        low-fidelity wireframes to validate layout and essential features, then progressively 
        refined these into high-fidelity mockups incorporating a consistent color palette, 
        branding elements, and final interaction details. 
      </p>
      
      <!-- Low-fidelity Wireframes -->
      <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        At the low-fidelity stage, we sketched basic layouts in pen-and-paper form and later 
        replicated them in Figma. Our primary focus was understanding the <strong>user’s navigation path</strong> 
        and <strong>flow feasibility</strong>, rather than final visual details. We conducted quick internal reviews 
        to confirm that the screens aligned with our main use cases (e.g., setting a medication reminder 
        or scheduling an appointment).
      </p>
      <div class="wireframe-grid">
        <img src="wireframe-login.png" alt="Login Wireframe" />

      <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;">High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
      <p>
        After refining the wireframes based on initial feedback and usability considerations, 
        we introduced brand colors, typography, and iconography. We ensured color contrast 
        met accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA at minimum), especially important for older 
        adults with visual impairments.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistent Navigation:</strong> Tabs and menu items remain in predictable locations 
        to reduce cognitive load.</li>
        <li><strong>Legible Typography:</strong> We selected a clean, sans-serif font with good 
        readability, even at smaller sizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Coding:</strong> Medication reminders have distinct accent colors to 
        stand out. Appointment or scheduling screens use a calmer hue to convey organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Microcopy & Iconography:</strong> Clear, concise labels and intuitive icons 
        help guide users.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- (7) USABILITY TESTING -->
    <section id="testing" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>7. Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>
        After creating our high-fidelity prototype, we conducted two rounds of usability testing. 
        The first round was <strong>internal testing</strong> with five team members simulating 
        user tasks to catch major usability flaws. The second round was <strong>external testing</strong> 
        with 6 participants drawn from our target audience (in line with our personas) to gather 
        real-world feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Test Goals & Methodology:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assess whether users could easily create an account or log in without confusion.</li>
        <li>Measure how quickly users could set a new medication reminder and confirm the dose taken.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the ease of scheduling an appointment and how users handle rescheduling or canceling.</li>
        <li>Observe interactions with the mental wellness features to gauge interest and discover any 
        friction points in discovering or accessing them.</li>
        <li>Identify any navigational or labeling issues that hinder user flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each test participant received a scenario-based script and performed tasks while 
        thinking out loud. We recorded screen interactions (with permission) and took 
        detailed notes on user pain points, confusion, or suggestions.
      </p>

      </table>

      <p>
        <strong>Iterative Changes Implemented:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Consolidated Appointment Scheduling:</strong> We merged “New Appointment” 
        and “Reschedule” into a single “Manage Appointments” interface, simplifying the 
        flow and making it more intuitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Validation:</strong> Added an inline alert if users skip 
        required fields like “Confirm Password” to reduce sign-up errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Onboarding Tutorial:</strong> We introduced brief pop-up tips for first-time 
        users to address the 17% that wanted more guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>Prominent CTAs:</strong> We re-labeled certain icons and moved the 
        “Add Medication” button to the screen’s focal area for clarity and consistency.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These improvements significantly polished our prototype, aligning it more closely 
        with real-world user needs.

    <!-- (8) REFLECTION & FUTURE STEPS -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>8. Reflection & Future Steps</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Challenges Faced:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Recruiting Older Adults:</strong> Finding participants aged 50+ for interviews 
          was difficult. We partnered with a local clinic, which eventually helped us connect 
          with our target demographic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Feature Overload:</strong> Balancing medications, appointments, and mental 
          wellness tools risked clutter. We continuously pruned and simplified to ensure 
          the core functionalities remained intuitive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy & Compliance:</strong> Users expressed concerns about data privacy. 
          We included disclaimers and are exploring HIPAA-compliant solutions for data handling.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Successes:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterative Feedback Loop:</strong> Frequent usability tests and internal 
          reviews enabled quick identification and resolution of design flaws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strong User Engagement:</strong> Early testers reported a 90% overall 
          task completion rate and felt more in control of their daily health management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accessible Design:</strong> Our color contrast and typography choices tested 
          well across multiple devices and age groups, enhancing overall usability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Engaging real users early avoids assumptions about usability.</li>
        <li>Communication with stakeholders (e.g., doctors, medical staff) helps shape 
        features that address real clinical workflows.</li>
        <li>Simplifying user flows has a massive impact on adoption, especially for 
        older or less tech-savvy individuals.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Next Steps:</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implement family-sharing and accountability features for group management</li>
        <li>Improve data visualization for daily/weekly medication adherence</li>
        <li>Enhance mental wellness section with additional resources and potential telehealth 
        integration for professional support</li>
        <li>Explore EHR (Electronic Health Records) integration for seamless patient-doctor communication</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, the UX design process brought clarity to our users’ real problems and empowered 
        us to iterate effectively, ensuring our product resonates with those who need it most.

    <!-- (9) CONCLUSION -->
    <section id="conclusion" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Health Companion Super App demonstrates how a user-centered design process can 
        simplify complex healthcare needs. By focusing on straightforward medication tracking, 
        flexible appointment scheduling, and a supportive mental wellness toolkit, we aim to 
        empower users to take control of their health every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through our user research, personas, journey mapping, and iterative usability tests, 
        we refined our design to address real concerns such as missed medications, limited 
        appointment slots, and mental stress. The end result is an intuitive, holistic 
        solution that resonates with a diverse user base.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Steve Jobs once said: 
        <em>“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”</em> 
        We believe our iterative design approach and deep user research have laid a strong 
        foundation for a product that truly <strong>works</strong> in the context of daily 
        healthcare management.
