      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Managing chronic health conditions usually involves multiple medications, 
        doctor appointments, tracking nutrition, and mental wellness. The 
        <strong>Health Companion Super App</strong> aims to simplify this process by 
        combining these tasks into one easy to use platform, for better health outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope:</strong> This case study documents the research, design, and testing process 
        behind building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the Health Companion Super App. 
        The app features medication reminders, appointment scheduling, and wellness 
        tools (e.g., mental health support, accountability features).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Objective:</strong> By focusing on a user-centered design approach, the aim is to 
        identify the real needs of individuals with chronic conditions, alleviate common pain points, 
        and offer a friendly solution to stay on top of their health. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Timely medication tracking and reminders</li>
        <li>Seamless doctor appointment scheduling and rescheduling</li>
        <li>Holistic wellness support, including mental and emotional health resources</li>
        <li>Accessible user flows to minimize complexity for any age group</li>

      <h2>2. User Research</h2>

      <p>
        The primary goal was to gather in-depth knowledge of users with chronic conditions and 
        their relationship with other digital tools that track their health information. We used a 
        <strong>mixed-methods approach</strong>, combining both quantitative and qualitative research:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Online Survey (40 respondents):</strong> Focused on daily medication habits, frequency 
        of missed doses, appointment scheduling methods, interest in mental wellness, and 
        preferred notification types.</li>
        <li><strong>In-depth Interviews (5 participants):</strong> Went deeper into personal challenges, 
        emotional triggers, and coping mechanisms. 
        Participants were 30–60 years old with chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and 
        chronic migraines.</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Research:</strong> Reviewed existing health apps (MyChart, Medisafe, 
        Talkspace) and journals to understand the best practices and common errors in managing
        chronic disease.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Key Insights from Research:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>App Overload:</strong> Users don't like having multiple apps for different health 
        tasks. A single integrated solution is preferred.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Adherence:</strong> Over <span class="highlight">60%</span> of participants admitted missing 
        at least one dose per week, showing a strong need for better reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Health Integration:</strong> A portion of users expressed interest in 
        mental wellness within the same app, and supporting stress management.</li>
        <li><strong>Communication with Healthcare Professionals:</strong> Slow or unclear communication 
        with doctors was a common complaint.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility & Usability:</strong> Many older users found other apps 
        difficult to navigate. A simple, clear UI is essential.</li>
      </ol>

        In summary, <strong>users demanded a single, user-friendly experience</strong> 
        that includes medication tracking and appointment scheduling while offering 
        mental health resources. The next step was to convert these results into 
        <em>personas</em> that would guide our design.

    <!-- (3) PERSONAS -->
    <section id="personas" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>3. Personas</h2>
      <p>
        Based on our research, I developed three personas to represent key users. 
        Each persona has different goals, motivations, and pain points, ensuring 
        that the design solutions would address a wide range of needs.
      </p>

      <div class="persona-grid">
        <!-- Persona 1: John -->
        <div class="persona-card">
          <img src="persona-john.jpg" alt="John, 57" class="persona-img" />
          <h3>John, 57 <span style="font-weight:400;">• Hypertension & High Cholesterol</span></h3>
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Track blood pressure meds, reduce hospital visits, manage diet tips.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Forgets medication doses, struggles with complex apps, 
          wants to share data with his family doctor.</p>
          <p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Independence, stable health for 
          family’s peace of mind, saving time on scheduling processes.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Persona 2: Alicia -->
        <div class="persona-card">
          <img src="persona-alicia.jpg" alt="Alicia, 33" class="persona-img" />
          <h3>Alicia, 33 <span style="font-weight:400;">• Migraines & Work-Life Balance</span></h3>
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Quickly log migraines, set medication reminders, explore stress management tools.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> A busy schedule, needs fast solutions, 
          doesn't want complicated sign-in pages every time.</p>
          <p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Minimizing downtime from migraines, addressing triggers.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Persona 3: Carlos -->
        <div class="persona-card">
          <img src="persona-carlos.jpg" alt="Carlos, 41" class="persona-img" />
          <h3>Carlos, 41 <span style="font-weight:400;">• Type 2 Diabetes</span></h3>
          <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Track insulin doses and diet, schedule regular checkups, share data with family.</p>
          <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Misses insulin doses due because of busy schedule, needs 
          real-time notifications, conceerned about data privacy.</p>
          <p><strong>Motivations:</strong> Maintaining stable glucose levels, reassuring family members, 
          improving diet by logging food intake and sugar levels.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Each persona guided decisions around <em>feature prioritization, information architecture, 
        and interface design</em>. I made sure that the design would be intuitive for both the tech-savvy 
        younger demographic (Alicia) and the older adults who struggle with technology (John), 
        and still meeting specialized needs (for Carlos).

    <!-- (4) USER JOURNEY MAP -->
    <section id="journeymap" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>4. User Journey Map</h2>
      <p>
        To understand the typical process a user would go through when interacting with the app, I've 
        created a journey map to reflect key stages and emotional states. This journey map focuses on 
        <strong>John’s experience</strong> from the moment 
        he realizes he needs to refill his blood pressure meds to scheduling a follow-up 
        with his cardiologist.
      </p>
      <img src="user-journey.jpg" alt="User Journey Map" class="journey-image" />
      <p class="caption">
      Key stages: Awareness → App Access → Medication Tracking → Appointment Scheduling → Follow-up
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>John’s Journey:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> John hears from his doctor about a new app to help manage 
        chronic conditions. He’s cautious but curious.</li>
        <li><strong>Onboarding & Setup:</strong> John downloads the app and sees a simple 
        onboarding page that explains how to enter his medication details. He worries it might 
        be too advanced, but quick tutorial tips guide him through the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Tracking:</strong> Once set up, John receives daily reminders 
        to log his blood pressure meds. He appreciates the push notifications but sometimes 
        forgets to open the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Doctor Communication:</strong> John notices he can send status 
        updates or questions to his doctor. He’s uncertain how 
        to phrase them, but the app’s suggested templates help him.</li>
        <li><strong>Appointment Booking:</strong> John tries scheduling a routine check-up. 
        The limited slot availability annoys him, but the app suggests alternatives, 
        reducing frustration and stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up & Long-Term Engagement:</strong> As John grows comfortable 
        with daily usage, he explores wellness tips and tries some exercises. 
        Over time, he feels more confident about managing his health.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By mapping each stage with John’s emotions, pain points, and opportunities, we 
        get the points of struggle (e.g., confusion during sign-up, difficulty scheduling 
        appointments, fear of complicated technology) and designed specific solutions 
        (e.g., intuitive onboarding, appointment scheduling alternatives, simple UI).

    <!-- (5) USER FLOWCHART -->
    <section id="userflow" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>5. User Flow</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a flowchart to outline the entire user path from Onboarding and Sign-Up 
        or Login, to the Home Dashboard, then navigating to Medications, Appointments, Wellness, 
        and Profile. It also covers sub-actions like adding medication reminders, 
        scheduling/rescheduling appointments, and more.
      </p>

      <p class="caption">
        Start → Onboarding → Login/Signup → Home → Medications / Appointments / Wellness / Profile
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Flow Rationale:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> If first-time user, they see a quick overview and can 
        skip or proceed with a tutorial. This accommodates users with different familiarity levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Login vs. Sign-Up:</strong> New users create an account, returning users 
        directly log in. “Forgot Password” flow is clearly accessible from the login screen.</li>
        <li><strong>Home Screen:</strong> Displays quick links to major features (Medication, 
        Appointment, Wellness, Profile). Users can easily jump back to the home screen 
        without confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication Screen:</strong> Facilitates adding/editing medication details, 
        logging doses, setting push reminders, and confirming doses taken.</li>
        <li><strong>Appointment Screen:</strong> Schedules new check-ups, reschedules or 
        cancels existing ones, and works with push notifications for reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Wellness Screen:</strong> Offers mental health exercises, daily mood 
        tracking, and resources to reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Screen:</strong> Contains the user info, family-sharing options, 
        accountability settings, and a logout button.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This user flow ensures minimal problems and quick access to essential features, 
        promoting consistent usage of the app over time.

    <!-- (6) WIREFRAMES & PROTOTYPE -->
    <section id="wireframes" class="section" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h2>6. Wireframes & High-Fidelity Screens</h2>
      <p>
        The design process followed an <strong>iterative approach</strong>. Starting with 
        low-fidelity wireframes to validate the layout and features, then progressively 
        refined these into high-fidelity mockups with a consistent color palette, and final interaction details. 
      </p>
      
      <!-- Low-fidelity Wireframes -->
      <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        At the low-fidelity stage, I sketched basic layouts on paper and later 
        replicated them in Figma. The primary focus was understanding the <strong>user’s navigation path</strong> 
        and <strong>flow feasibility</strong>, over the final visual details.
      </p>
      <div class="wireframe-grid">
        <img src="wireframe-login.png" alt="Login Wireframe" />

      <!-- High-fidelity Mockups -->
      <h3 style="margin-top:2rem;">High-Fidelity Mockups</h3>
      <p>
        After refining the wireframes based on the initial feedback and usability considerations, 
        I introduced colors, typography, and iconography. I ensured color contrast wasn't too much
        especially for older adults with visual impairments.

        <strong>Key Design Decisions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistent Navigation:</strong> Tabs and menu items remain in predictable locations 
        to reduce cognitive load.</li>
        <li><strong>Legible Typography:</strong> A clean font with good 
        readability, even at smaller sizes was used.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Coding:</strong> Medication reminders have distinct accent colors to 
        stand out. Appointment or scheduling screens use a calmer one to show organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Iconography:</strong> Clear, concise labels and intuitive icons to
        help guide users through the app.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>
        After creating the high-fidelity prototype, I conducted a round of usability testing. 
        It consisted of 6 participants from the target audience (in line with the personas) to gather 
        real-world feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Test Goals & Methodology:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assess whether users could easily create an account or log in without confusion.</li>
        <li>Measure how quickly users could set a new medication reminder and confirm the dose taken.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the process of scheduling an appointment and how users handle rescheduling or canceling.</li>
        <li>Observe interactions with the mental wellness features to understand the level interest and discover any 
        problems with accessing them.</li>
        <li>Identify any navigational or labeling issues that affect the user flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each test participant got a scenario-based script and performed the tasks while 
        thinking out loud. I took detailed notes on the user's pain points, confusion, or suggestions.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <p>
        Below is a summary of the most significant results from the test group:
      </p>
      <table class="testing-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Feature Tested</th>

            <td>Medication Reminder</td>
            <td>6/6 (100%)</td>
            <td>All found the “Add Medication” button easily</td>
            <td>Adding a quick tutorial for first-time users</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Appointment Scheduling</td>
            <td>4/6 (66%)</td>
            <td>Two users confused between “Reschedule” and “New Appointment”</td>
            <td>Combine “Schedule” & “Reschedule” under one “Manage Appointments” screen</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Mental Wellness Exercise</td>
            <td>6/6 (100%)</td>
            <td>Users appreciated quick access & short instructions</td>
            <td>Have more variety of exercises in future updates</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        <strong>Changes Implemented:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Consolidated Appointment Scheduling:</strong> Merged “New Appointment” 
        and “Reschedule” into a single “Manage Appointments” interface, simplifying the 
        flow and making it more intuitive.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Validation:</strong> Added an inline alert if users skip 
        required fields like “Confirm Password” to reduce sign-up errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Onboarding Tutorial:</strong> Added a brief pop-up for first-time 
        users to address the 17% that wanted more guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>Prominent CTAs:</strong> Re-labeled icons and moved the 
        “Add Medication” button to the screen’s focal area for clarity and consistency.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These improvements significantly improved the prototype, aligning it more with what real-world user needs.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Recruiting Older Adults:</strong> Finding participants aged 50+ for interviews

      <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Health Companion Super App demonstrates how a user-centered design process can 
        simplify healthcare needs. By focusing on simple medication tracking, 
        flexible appointment scheduling, and supportive mental wellness tools, the aim is to 
        empower users to take control of their health every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the user research, personas, journey mapping, and usability tests, 
        the design was refined to address and solve real concerns such as missed medications, limited 
        appointment slots, and mental stress. The end result is an intuitive, holistic 
        solution that resonates with a diverse user base.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Steve Jobs once said: 
        <em>“Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”</em> 
        This iterative design approach and deep user research laid a solid 
        foundation for a product that truly <strong>works</strong> in the context of daily 
        healthcare management.
