  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Managing chronic health conditions often involves juggling multiple medications, 
      doctor appointments, nutrition tracking, and mental wellness checks. The 
      <strong>Health Companion Super App</strong> aims to simplify this process by 
      consolidating these tasks into one seamless platform, fostering better health outcomes 
      and improved user adherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Scope:</strong> This case study documents the research, design, and testing process 
      behind building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for the Health Companion Super App. 
      The app features medication reminders, appointment scheduling, and additional wellness 
      tools (e.g., mental health support, accountability features).

  <!-- RESEARCH SECTION -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>2. User Research</h2>
    <p>
      We conducted an <strong>online survey</strong> with 40 participants and 
      <strong>5 in-depth interviews</strong> to understand user needs:
    </p>

    <!-- Chart 1 -->
    <h3>Medication Tracking Methods</h3>
    <img src="chart1.png" alt="Medication Tracking Methods" class="image" />
    <p class="caption">
      70% use manual methods (like pillboxes), while 30% rely on mobile apps for medication tracking.
    </p>

    <!-- Chart 2 -->
    <h3>Frequency of Forgotten Doses</h3>
    <img src="chart2.png" alt="Frequency of Forgotten Doses" class="image" />
    <p class="caption">
      60% frequently forget at least one dose per week. Only 15% rarely forget.
    </p>

    <!-- Chart 3 -->
    <h3>Most Requested Features</h3>
    <img src="chart3.png" alt="Feature Requests" class="image" />
    <ul>
      <li>Appointment scheduling & easy rescheduling (65%)</li>
      <li>Simplified medication reminders (58%)</li>
      <li>Family sharing & accountability (35%)</li>
      <li>Mental wellness tips (30%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="caption">Top requested features from user survey</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key Insights:</strong> Users want a single, user-friendly app to handle both 
      medications and appointments. Many also expressed interest in mental wellness resources 
      (e.g., relaxation exercises, community support).
    </p>

  <!-- PERSONAS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. Personas</h2>
    <p>
      Based on our research, we developed three personas representing key user segments. 
      These helped us keep user needs front and center throughout the design process.
    </p>

    <!-- Persona 1: John -->
    <div class="persona">
      <img src="persona-john.jpg" alt="John, 57" class="persona-img" />
      <h3>John, 57 • Hypertension & High Cholesterol</h3>
      <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Track blood pressure meds, reduce hospital visits, manage diet tips.</p>
      <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Forgets medication doses, struggles with complicated apps, 
      wants to share data with family doctor easily.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Persona 2: Alicia -->
    <div class="persona">
      <img src="persona-alicia.jpg" alt="Alicia, 33" class="persona-img" />
      <h3>Alicia, 33 • Migraines & Work-Life Balance</h3>
      <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Quickly log migraines, set medication reminders, find stress management tools.</p>
      <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Juggling a busy schedule, needs fast, on-the-go solutions, 
      doesn't want complicated sign-in flows every time.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Persona 3: Carlos -->
    <div class="persona">
      <img src="persona-carlos.jpg" alt="Carlos, 41" class="persona-img" />
      <h3>Carlos, 41 • Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
      <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Track insulin doses and diet, schedule regular checkups, sync data with family.</p>
      <p><strong>Pain Points:</strong> Misses insulin doses due to busy shift schedule, needs 
      real-time push notifications, uncertain about data privacy.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- USER JOURNEY MAP -->

    <h2>4. User Journey Map</h2>
    <p>
      The following journey map focuses on <strong>John’s experience</strong> from the moment 
      he realizes he needs to refill his blood pressure meds to scheduling a follow-up with his cardiologist.

    <p>
      Below is a simplified flowchart outlining key paths: Onboarding/Sign-Up, Logging In, 
      accessing the Home screen, navigating to Medications, Appointments, Profile, 
      and additional wellness features.

  <!-- WIREFRAMES & PROTOTYPE -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>6. Wireframes & High-Fidelity Screens</h2>
    <p>
      We began with low-fidelity wireframes to validate layout and essential features. 
      Then, we iterated to a high-fidelity prototype in Figma.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Low-fidelity Wireframes -->
    <div class="wireframe-grid">
      <img src="wireframe-login.png" alt="Login Wireframe" class="image" />

  <!-- USABILITY TESTING -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>7. Usability Testing</h2>
    <p>
      We conducted usability testing with 6 participants who matched our personas’ age range 
      and health conditions. Each participant was asked to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an account or log in (if they had existing credentials)</li>
      <li>Set a new medication reminder for the next day</li>
      <li>Schedule a doctor’s appointment for an available time slot</li>
      <li>Access a mental wellness “relaxation exercise”</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Feature Tested</th>
          <th>Success Rate</th>
          <th>Observations</th>
          <th>Proposed Changes</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Account Creation</td>
          <td>5/6 (83%)</td>
          <td>One user missed the “confirm password” field</td>
          <td>Add real-time validation, highlight missing fields</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Medication Reminder</td>
          <td>6/6 (100%)</td>
          <td>All found the “Add Medication” button easily</td>
          <td>Consider adding a quick tutorial for first-time users</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Appointment Scheduling</td>
          <td>4/6 (66%)</td>
          <td>Two users confused about the “Reschedule” vs “New Appointment” flow</td>
          <td>Combine “Schedule” & “Reschedule” under one “Manage Appointments” screen</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Mental Wellness Exercise</td>
          <td>6/6 (100%)</td>
          <td>Users appreciated quick access & short instructions</td>
          <td>Push more variety of exercises in future updates</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
      After analyzing results, we simplified the appointment scheduler (combining “New” and 
      “Reschedule” into a single “Manage” interface). We also added real-time form validation 
      for the sign-up flow.

  <!-- REFLECTION & FUTURE STEPS -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>8. Reflection & Future Steps</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Challenges:</strong> Reaching older adults for interviews was difficult, so we 
      partnered with local clinics to gather more representative data. Additionally, balancing 
      multiple features (medications, appointments, mental wellness) without overwhelming the 
      user required careful iterative testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Successes:</strong> Our iterative approach and usability testing helped us 
      prioritize the most-used features. The final prototype tested well, with a 90% overall 
      task completion rate and high satisfaction scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Next Steps:</strong> 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement family-sharing and accountability features for group management</li>
      <li>Improve data visualization for daily/weekly medication adherence</li>
      <li>Enhance mental wellness section with more resources and professional support channels</li>
      <li>Explore EHR (Electronic Health Records) integration for seamless patient-doctor communication</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- CONCLUSION -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>9. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The Health Companion Super App demonstrates how a user-centered design process can 
      simplify complex healthcare needs. By focusing on straightforward medication tracking, 
      flexible appointment scheduling, and a supportive mental wellness toolkit, we aim to 
      empower users to take control of their health every day.

    <h2>10. Additional Screens</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond the core wireframes, our final MVP included a total of eight pages. Below are final 
      mockups for each screen, showcasing the simplified navigation and consistent design language:
